Each item is displayed in a clean card layout featuring images, names, descriptions, and prices, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
The site adapts perfectly to all screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. JavaScript adds simple interactivity—such as clickable cards that show a selected dish alert—creating a more engaging experience for users.

This project is ideal for restaurant owners, front-end developers, or students looking to build and showcase a professional food-related website. It’s lightweight, fast-loading, and easy to customize .
